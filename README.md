# My Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website project! This website showcases my portfolio, projects, and provides information about me.

## Features and Challenges Faced
During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges:

**Responsive Design:** 
The website is designed to be accessible on various devices, providing a seamless user experience.

 **Navigation:** 
Users can easily navigate through different sections using the navigation menu.

 **Responsive Design:** 
 Ensuring a consistent and appealing design across different screen sizes required careful consideration and testing.

**CSS Styling:** 
Implementing specific styling, such as the background images and hover effects, required experimenting with various CSS properties.


## New CSS Properties Learned

1. Media Queries (@media)
During the development of this project, I successfully implemented @media queries to enhance the responsiveness of the website. This allowed me to adjust styles and layout based on different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience across various devices.

2.CSS Animations
I successfully incorporated CSS animations to enhance the visual appeal of the website. One notable example is the animation of a set of decorative elements using the @keyframes rule. This animation creates a dynamic and engaging effect on the page.

3.PDF File Integration
I successfully added a PDF file to the website, providing users with the ability to download and view additional content.

4.Social Icons with Links
To enhance user connectivity, I added social icons with links to personal profiles on platforms such as LinkedIn, Instagram, and email. This was achieved by incorporating appropriate icon fonts and linking them to the respective profiles.
